## Installation Instructions:
### Windows:
1. Download and install Devkitpro. You can follow steps 4-6 from [this tutorial](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=8825585&postcount=96). You may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

2. Download the latest version of Python 3.7 (3.7.6). **DO NOT DOWNLOAD PYTHON 3.8!**
After downloading and before proceeding to install, make sure that the **add to path** checkbox is ticked, otherwise you'll have to add the Python path in the environment variables manually. If you have installed multiple Python versions, please make sure that Python 3.6+ can be explicitly called with command `python3`.

3. Download (or clone) the master folder from this github page.
(Click 'Clone or Download', then 'Download Zip')

4. Get your ROM, rename it to **BPRE0.gba** and place it the main (master) folder.

5. To decide the offsets where you want to insert the code:
In 'scripts/make.py' change `OFFSET_TO_PUT=YYY` to the location you want to insert the data. Don't worry about changing *insert.py* because *make.py* automatically updates *insert.py* and *linker.ld*.

6. Run **cmd.exe** from the **main folder**. You can do this by typing `cmd` and hitting enter in the
url address or selecting *Open command window here* from right clicking on empty space while holding the shift key. If the command line contains */scripts* when showing the current directory, you are in the wrong place.

7. In the command prompt window, type `python scripts//make.py` (or `python3 scripts//make.py` if you've installed multiple python versions).

7.5. If you get an error with a mention of a file called **libwinpthread-1.dll** (or something similar), search Google for a 64-bit version of this file and add it to the root.

A new gba file will appear named as **test.gba** and an **offsets.ini** file.
Those are your resultant files.

### UNIX-like OS (Linux, MacOS, ...):
1. Install devkitPro with instructions [here](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

2. Export `${DEVKITARM}/bin/` to your `PATH` variable.

3. Make sure you've installed python 3.6+ and it can be called directly via either `python` or `python3`.

4. Clone the repo and go inside:   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Skeli789/Complete-Fire-Red-Upgrade
cd Complete-Fire-Red-Upgrade
```

5. Get your ROM into the current directory and rename it to **BPRE0.gba**.

6. Configure the offset you want to insert the code:
In *scripts/make.py* change `OFFSET_TO_PUT=YYY` to the location you want to insert the data.

7. Run `python scripts/make.py` (or `python3 scripts/make.py` if you’ve installed multiple python versions).

A new gba file will appear named as **test.gba** and an **offsets.ini** file.
Those are your resultant files.

## Notes

Anytime you make changes, the compiler will only compile the files you have changed.

### Specific to Windows
Any changes made to header files will require you to type ``python scripts//clean.py build``
in cmd and then rerun the build scripts. For more command line options, see "Engine
Scripts" in the documentation.

### Specific to UNIX-like OS (linux, macOS, ...):
Any changes made to header files will require you to clean everything in *build/* and then rerun the build scripts.
